Hey there! I'm Andrea, freshly minted with a degree in Mathematics and a passion for the applied side of things! With a strong focus on the applied math track, I'm all about cracking codes and uncovering quantitative solutions in real-world scenarios.

I’ve created this simple site to organise my online space and to share a bit more about what I’m interested in.
