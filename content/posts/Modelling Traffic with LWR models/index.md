<!--In 2024 I graduated with a Master's degree in Mathematics from the University of Verona.-->
My Master's thesis, titled "Data-Driven Modelling and Calibration of Multi-Agent Systems," focuses on two main targets:

1. Investigating the Discrete-to-Continuum transition in traffic dynamics, underlying the relationship between macroscopic and microscopic models.
2. Employing neural network-driven models to simulate particle interaction dynamics, particularly in a traffic scenario.

To address the parameter estimation challenge, I contextualized the problem within optimal control framework and utilized data provided by the [Esimas Project](https://github.com/ctotzeck/NN-interaction).

For further insights, please explore my [presentation](https://andreamortaro.github.io/TrafficPresentation/) created with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), and examine the codes available on my GitHub repository [TrafficModelling](https://github.com/andreamortaro/TrafficModelling).
