## introduction

Finding "The One" is not an easy business. How many frogs must you kiss to secure your chances of getting a prince or a princess? 

In general, when we are trying to pick the best among many options there are two ways to fail:
* stopping too early, risking to regret possibile good options.
* stopping too late, falling into an analysis paralysis.

So the question is: **how many options do we need to consider before to pick?** Such question arises in several decisional processes of real life, from choosing an apartment to deciding who to ‘settle down’ with. Mathematicians study such problems


## historical background



 Mathematicians denote such problem as "Optimal Stopping problem".

The most famous formulation is the "Secretary problem", in which we are interested to hire the best candidate.
