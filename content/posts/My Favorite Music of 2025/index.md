## Top 5 Albums of 2025

### Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist - *Alfredo 2*

Alfredo 2 is a smooth, vibey ride from start to finish. Gibbs moves effortlessly over cinematic, textured beats, creating an atmosphere that’s both relaxed and intense. I loved how the album balances gritty storytelling with laid-back grooves, and the chemistry with The Alchemist makes every track feel carefully crafted.

### Rosalía – *LUX*

Rosalía’s LUX is a highly praised 2025 release that blends experimental pop with orchestral and classical influences, exploring themes of divinity, femininity, and mortality with ambition and emotional depth.

The closing track “Magnolias” is a highlight, especially for its rich use of horns and orchestral textures — the main reason it stood out to me.


### Black Country, New Road - *Forever Howlong*

Forever Howlong shows BCNR’s virtuosity and creativity, even after Isaac Wood’s departure. I really enjoyed it; the album is more accessible and playful, yet still intense, though Ants From Up There remains stronger. Seeing them live made their inventiveness even more striking. My favorite track, Nancy Tries to Take the Night, perfectly captures their whimsical yet intense energy.

### Saya Gray – *SAYA*

Saya Gray’s *SAYA* is a critically well-received 2025 album that blends indie pop/rock, art pop, and experimental touches into a vivid, emotionally charged breakup record.

The track *“H.B.W.”* stood out to me in particular — its moody, trip-hop-tinged beat and haunting atmosphere make it one of the most memorable moments on the record.


### Darkside – *Nothing*

*Nothing* is Darkside’s third studio album, praised for its adventurous mix of electronic, rock, funk, and loose improvisation. The expanded trio sound leans into warped textures and immersive, genre-bending atmospheres.

I especially loved *“American References”* — its hypnotic groove and percussion stand out, and the atmosphere is what really drew me in.
