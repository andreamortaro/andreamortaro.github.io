## Top 5 Albums of 2025

### Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist - *Alfredo 2*

Alfredo 2 is a smooth, vibey ride from start to finish. Gibbs moves effortlessly over cinematic, textured beats, creating an atmosphere that’s both relaxed and intense. I loved how the album balances gritty storytelling with laid-back grooves, and the chemistry with The Alchemist makes every track feel carefully crafted.

### Black Country, New Road - *Forever Howlong*

Forever Howlong shows BCNR’s virtuosity and creativity, even after Isaac Wood’s departure. I really enjoyed it; the album is more accessible and playful, yet still intense, though Ants From Up There remains stronger. Seeing them live made their inventiveness even more striking. My favorite track, Nancy Tries to Take the Night, perfectly captures their whimsical yet intense energy.
