Just got back from the Radiohead concert in Bologna — emotional, intense, and unforgettable. I honestly never expected to see them live. After so many years without a proper tour, this felt like a dream come true.

I loved many of the performances — from the intimate, immersive magic of *Videotape* and *Weird Fishes* to the standout **highlights** of the night: *How To Disappear Completely*, haunting and ethereal, and *The National Anthem*, which erupted with chaotic energy. Every moment had its own magic, and even songs I had heard countless times on record felt completely new live.

Of course, I missed a few favorites — *Nude*, *Pyramid Song*, *Idioteque*, *Present Tense* — but honestly, those two-plus hours were overflowing with emotion and unforgettable memories.

And now for a **fun anecdote**: they played *Talk Show Host* — not one of my personal favorites, but hearing it live was a rare and beautiful surprise. I recognized the song right away, but at first I didn’t understand why they were playing it that night, since it hadn’t appeared on this tour. Later, I discovered the reason... **Leonardo DiCaprio** was in the arena! So yes… I can officially say that, for one magical evening, I shared a room with him! 😄

I’ve uploaded some of my recordings from the concert to my YouTube account — hope you enjoy reliving the night with me.
