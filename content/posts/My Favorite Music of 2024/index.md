## Top 5 Albums of 2024

### The Smile - *Wall of Eyes* & *Cutouts*

The second album from The Smile (*Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Tom Skinner*), *Wall of Eyes*, stands out for its cinematic style and existential themes. The title track is a suggestive bossa nova and "Teleharmonic" is a real gem, even though I especially loved the drum and bass version featured in Peaky Blinders (and I’m still hoping they release that version!). The album overall feels cohesive and thoughtfully crafted, with each listen revealing more depth.

Cutouts explores a darker, more experimental side. The ambient "Foreign Spies" and the eerie bossa nova of "Bodies Laughing" stand out, while "Instant Psalm" channels a Radiohead-esque ballad that adds emotional weight to this shadowy album.

### Floating Points - *Cascade*

*Cascade* sees Floating Points (Sam Shepherd) refine his minimalist electronic sound. While I preferred *Crush*, this album captivates with its ambient textures and introspective atmosphere. His collaboration with Pharoah Sanders in *Promises* remains a highlight of his work.

This collaborative EP pairs Baby Rose’s soulful vocals with BadBadNotGood's moody jazz, creating a rich blend of R&B and jazz that stands out in 2024.
