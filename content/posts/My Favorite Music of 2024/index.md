## Top 5 Albums of 2024

### The Smile - *Wall of Eyes* & *Cutouts*

The second album from The Smile (*Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Tom Skinner*), *Wall of Eyes*, stands out for its cinematic style and existential themes. The title track is a suggestive bossa nova and "Teleharmonic" is a real gem, even though I especially loved the drum and bass version in *Peaky Blinders*. The album overall feels cohesive and thoughtfully crafted, with each listen revealing more depth.

*Cutouts* explores a darker, more experimental side. The ambient "Foreign Spies" and the eerie bossa nova of "Bodies Laughing" stand out, while "Instant Psalm" channels a Radiohead-esque ballad that adds emotional weight to this shadowy album.

### Tyler, The Creator - *CHROMAKOPIA*

"Chromakopia" by Tyler, the Creator marks a mature and introspective turn, exploring themes of identity and family. Musically, it blends jazz, funk, and hip-hop, alternating between lighter tracks like "Sticky" and deeper moments like "Take Your Mask Off," which is my favorite.
