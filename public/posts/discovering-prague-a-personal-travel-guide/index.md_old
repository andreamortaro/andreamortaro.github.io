## Introduction

I recently spent three days in Prague, and I’d love to share my experience — from the routes I followed to the places I ate and the hidden gems I discovered along the way.

A big thanks to Eleonora Ongaro’s guide for helping me shape this trip! <cite>[^eo]</cite> 🙏

All the photos here are my own, taken during the trip.

## 🗓 My 3-Day Itinerary

### Day 1: A Rainy Start at the National Museum

The first day was rainy, so I focused on one main highlight:
- **National Museum (Wenceslas Square)** – a huge and fascinating museum with a variety of exhibits:
- *Natural History* → animals, skeletons, fossils, minerals
- *Czech History* → from ancient Bohemia to modern times
- *Music & Arts* → instruments and cultural artifacts
- *Temporary Exhibitions* → different aspects of Czech culture

Even with bad weather, this was the perfect introduction to Prague’s culture and history.



### Day 2 – The Classic Prague Experience

**Morning: Iconic Landmarks**

- **Astronomical Clock (Orloj)**
Located on the southern wall of the Old Town Hall, the Orloj is the third oldest astronomical clock in the world and the oldest still operating.
Every hour, the "Walk of the Apostles" shows twelve apostle figures moving in windows above the clock.

- **Old Town Square (Staroměstské náměstí)**
Surrounded by colorful baroque buildings, home to the Church of Our Lady before Týn and the Old Town Hall.
A vibrant area with cafes and street performers.

We climbed the clock tower and enjoyed a panoramic view of the entire Old Town Square from above. <---- DA SISTEMARE

- **Charles Bridge (Karlův most)**
A 14th-century stone bridge connecting the Old Town to Malá Strana, adorned with 30 statues of saints.

- **Local Markets**
Explore the markets near Old Town Square for Czech crafts, souvenirs, and traditional food.

**Afternoon: Castle and Beer**

- **Prague Castle (Pražský hrad)**
A historic castle complex from the 9th century including St. Vitus Cathedral, the Old Royal Palace, and Golden Lane.

In realtà non è davvero un castello, ma un complesso... da capir

- **Pilsner Urquell Experience** 🍺
Guided tour of the brewery in Plzeň with tastings and insights into the brewing process of the world's first pale lager.

Molto turistca ma divertente, ho apprezzato molto la dark lager con il suo retrogusto al caramello, liquirizia.


### Day 3 – Modern Art and Green Views

**Morning: Contemporary Prague**
- **Sigmund Freud Statue** → quirky artwork by David Černý showing Freud hanging from a pole above the street.

![freud](/img/freud.jpg)

- **Franz Kafka’s Head** → a 11-meter kinetic sculpture made of 42 rotating steel layers that reassemble Kafka’s face every 15 minutes. Peccato che quando sono andato non ruotasse!

![kafta](/img/05_kafta.jpg)

- **Dancing House (Fred & Ginger)** → modern architectural icon by Frank Gehry, representing a dancing couple. Più turistica che altro

![dh](/img/dh.jpg)


**Lunch:** hearty meat dish at a local restaurant.

**Afternoon: Green Prague**
- **Petřín Hill & Observation Tower** 🗼
Walked through the gardens up to the “mini Eiffel Tower” of Prague (63m). From the top, breathtaking views over the whole city.
- **Strahov Monastery & Library** → attempted to visit the famous baroque library, but the line was too long to get in.

## Cucina e birreria da raggruppare!

## 🍻 Breweries Worth Visiting
Besides U Fleků, I’d also recommend:
- **U Zlatého Tygra** – traditional and loved by locals.
- **U Černého Vola** – authentic and close to Prague Castle.
- **Pivovar U Tří růží** – great food and home-brewed beers.
- **Novoměstský pivovar** – big, lively, and perfect for a hearty Czech meal.

**Evening: Beer & Food**
- **U Fleků Brewery** 🍺
Founded in 1499, this is one of Prague’s oldest and most atmospheric breweries. Tried their **dark lager** while enjoying traditional Czech food and live music.
- **Dinner highlight:** cheese soup (*česnečka*) – the perfect comfort food to end the trip.

## Culinary Highlights

- **Traditional Czech Soup** → hearty soups like *kulajda* or *česnečka*.
- **Pastrami Dish** → served with sauerkraut and dumplings, a taste of traditional Czech cuisine.

## ✨ Final Thoughts
Even with rain and queues, Prague felt magical.
From gothic churches to modern art, from hearty soups to historic breweries, every corner had something to surprise me.
It’s definitely a city I’d love to return to — hopefully with more sunshine next time!
